# Watershed Management Project

## Project Overview

The Watershed Management Project is an initiative aimed at effectively managing and conserving water resources across various states and districts in India. This web application provides tools for visualizing watershed data and predicting project costs based on historical information.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Dashboard**: Displays total projects, area covered, and costs.
- **State-wise and District-wise Data Visualization**: Provides visual insights into watershed management data.
- **Machine Learning-based Cost Prediction Tool**: Estimates costs for new projects based on location and area.
- **User Authentication System**: Ensures secure access to the application.

## How It Works

Our application uses historical data from various watershed management projects across India. The dashboard provides an overview of the current state of projects, while the prediction tool uses machine learning algorithms to estimate costs for new projects based on location and area.

## Data Sources

The data used in this application is sourced from government records, satellite imagery, and on-ground surveys conducted by various agencies involved in watershed management across India. We regularly update our database to ensure the most accurate and current information is available to our users.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python with Flask framework
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript with Bootstrap for responsive design
- **Data Visualization**: Plotly.js
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn for predictive modeling

## Get Started

To use the application:

1. **Sign Up**: Create an account to access the full features.
2. **Log In**: If you already have an account, log in to start using the dashboard and prediction tools.
3. **Dashboard**: View overall statistics and trends.
4. **Cost Prediction Tool**: Estimate expenses for new watershed management projects in your area.

## Future Enhancements

We are continuously working to improve the Watershed Management Project. Planned features include:

- **Integration with Real-time Weather Data**: For more accurate predictions.
- **Advanced Reporting Tools**: To generate customized reports.
- **Mobile Application**: For on-field data collection and analysis.
- **Collaboration Tools**: For stakeholders to share insights and best practices.
